Title					: Vehicle Dynamics Project Portfolio
Vehicle dynamics (CAE Multibody Simulation) projects and related research activities performed at Jaguar Land Rover (UK), Daimler India Commercial Vehicles India, Honda (Japan), Tata Motors, TVS, ARAI.

Objective				: Steady-State Handling Behaviour of Passenger Vehicle and Sensitivity StudyAbstract				: Evaluate the vehicle concerning behaviour, responsive of the vehicle to driver inputs using steady-state test methods: Constant radius, Constant Steering wheel angle, constant speed with discrete turn radii and constant speed with discrete steering wheel angles. Initially correlated the multibody dynamics model and then carried sensitivity studies for various vehicle parameters:  Axle loads, Cornering stiffness, Vehicle CoG Distance from front axle, Vehicle CoG height, Antiroll Bar StiffnessMeasurable Parameters	: Under Steer Gradient, Steering Wheel Angle vs Lateral Acceleration, Chassis Body Yaw Angle vs Lateral Acceleration, Body Roll Angle vs Lateral Acceleration, Turning Circle Radius, Tire Slip Angles, Tire Lateral Cornering ForceTools Used				: MSC Adams, MATLAB/Simulink

Objective				: Optimization of Vehicle Handling Performance using Torque Vectoring DifferentialAbstract				: Using active driveline system – torque vectoring differential evaluate vehicle handling performance for steady-state and transient conditions, compare with open differential - passive/conventional driveline results to show performance improvement index. Keeping initial results of active driveline results as baseline, optimize the active driveline controls – torque shift for driving inputs and terrains to improve the directional stability.Measurable Parameters	: Drive wheel torque, Steering Wheel Angle, Chassis Lateral Acceleration, Driver Seat Acceleration(X,Y,Z), Body Roll angle, Chassis Yaw Angle, Wheel Linear and Rotational Velocities, Tire Slip Angles, Tire Lateral Cornering ForceTools Used				: MSC Adams, SIMPACK, MATLAB/Simulink
Objective				: Optimisation of vehicle traction control (TCS) for icy surfaceAbstract				: Due to network delay (up to 300ms) in traction control system, there will unnecessary wheel slipping shoot up and loss of vehicle control momentarily till TCS get fully activated. Developed a control system (plant model with 50ms delay) to resolve the momentarily loss of control of vehicle. Using Test data of failed response, developed and implemented a wheel speed vs tire slip curve, which acts as a limiter to cut off the throttle and smooth handover to TCS. For this activity used co-simulation – SIMPACK Virtual Full vehicle MBS model and SIMULINK Vehicle control system.Measurable Parameters	: Individual Wheel speed Linear & Rotational, Vehicle Speed, Engine Torque, Throttle Position, Engine RPMTools Used				: SIMPACK, MATLAB/Simulink
